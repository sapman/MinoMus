                MinoMus is a framework that was build to help building the basics of each good MonoGame game. <br>
                The framework contains multiple namespaces, each will help you in a diffrent section in your own created game, starting from the UI (Main menu mainly) and to the 3D basic must-have classes of your game, like basics types of cameras, printing methdos and so on... <br>

        <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-2 alert alert-info">
            <big>
               The framework is very simple and simplistic, means that it won't do anything for you, but it gives you the ultimate power to do as you will.
                In this little documentation, you'll learn the basic use of MinoMus framework. For further information, you are welcome to contact the developer by email: <i>sapirush97@gmail.com</i>.
